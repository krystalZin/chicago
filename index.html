            <h2 class="sub-title">History</h2>
            <p>Chicago's history is a story of remarkable transformation. From its early days as a strategic trading
                post to its incorporation as a bustling city in 1837, the Windy City has always been on the move. The
                Great Chicago Fire of 1871, though devastating, led to innovative urban planning and the birth of the
                skyscraper. During Prohibition, Chicago earned notoriety for its speakeasies and gangsters, with Al
                Capone at the helm. The city also played a pivotal role in the Civil Rights Movement, with Dr. Martin
                Luther King Jr.'s efforts against racial segregation. Today, Chicago stands as a global metropolis
                celebrated for its diverse culture, iconic architecture, and sports legacy, showcasing a rich and
                ever-evolving history.</p>

        <div>
            <h2 class="sub-title">World's First Skyscraper</h2>
            <p>Chicago's claim to fame as the birthplace of the world's first skyscraper rests on the shoulders of the
                remarkable Home Insurance Building. Erected in 1885, this 10-story marvel of architecture defied
                conventional building standards of its time. Designed by William Le Baron Jenney, the structure employed
                a
                revolutionary steel skeleton framework, enabling it to reach unprecedented heights. This innovation
                paved
                the way for the soaring skyscrapers that now define modern cityscapes worldwide. The Home Insurance
                Building
                stands as a testament to Chicago's pioneering spirit and its enduring legacy in the evolution of
                architectural design.</p>

                landmarks. Chicago's culinary scene is equally impressive, boasting renowned restaurants serving
                everything from deep-dish pizza to gourmet fusion cuisine. Beyond culture and cuisine, sports are a

                Chicago Bulls in basketball. Together, these elements paint a vibrant portrait of a city that embodies
                the best of contemporary urban living. Whether you're exploring its world-class museums or strolling
