        <p>Chicago's history is a story of remarkable transformation. From its early days as a strategic trading
          post to its incorporation as a bustling city in 1837, the Windy City has always been on the move.
          The
          Great Chicago Fire of 1871, though devastating, led to innovative urban planning and the birth of
          the
          skyscraper. During Prohibition, Chicago earned notoriety for its speakeasies and gangsters, with Al
          Capone at the helm. The city also played a pivotal role in the Civil Rights Movement, with Dr.
          Martin
          Luther King Jr.'s efforts against racial segregation. Today, Chicago stands as a global metropolis
          celebrated for its diverse culture, iconic architecture, and sports legacy, showcasing a rich and
          ever-evolving history.</p>

      <div class="col-sm col-md col-lg mx-3 box">
        <p class="fs-4 mt-3">World's First Skyscraper</p>
        <p>Chicago's claim to fame as the birthplace of the world's first skyscraper rests on the shoulders of
          the
          remarkable Home Insurance Building. Erected in 1885, this 10-story marvel of architecture defied
          conventional building standards of its time. Designed by William Le Baron Jenney, the structure
          employed
          a
          revolutionary steel skeleton framework, enabling it to reach unprecedented heights. This innovation
          paved
          the way for the soaring skyscrapers that now define modern cityscapes worldwide. The Home Insurance
          Building
          stands as a testament to Chicago's pioneering spirit and its enduring legacy in the evolution of
          architectural design.</p>
